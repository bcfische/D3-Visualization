Data Journalism

Here, we examine information from the U.S. Census Bureau and the Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System. The dataset is based
on 2014 ACS 1-year estimates (https://factfinder.census.gov/faces/nav/jsf/pages/searchresults.xhtml), and includes data on rates
of income, obesity, poverty, etc. by state. D3 is used to create a dynamic scatter plot comparing various risk and demographic factors.
